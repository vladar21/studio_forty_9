# studio_forty_9

1. Create a Symfony bundle to handle product inventory. It should be installable in a vanilla Symfony app using MySQL as the database.

2. Create a command to read stock data from the provided CSV file. The directory location should be configurable and should be relative to the web root.

3. Create a doctrine entity for the stock data

4. Save the stock data into the database - perform an update when the stock and location values already exist

5. Create a controller action to present the stock data (styling not important)

6. Create a controller action to accept posted stock data and save into the db

7. When processing stock data determine when a stock item is going out of stock (so value changing from a positive value to 0)

8. Trigger a message using the messenger component (https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html) when an item goes out of stock

9. Create a message handler to send an email notification to a configurable email address. The email should contain text describing that the SKU is out of stock at a particular location

10. For the above, create unit/functional tests where appropriate
